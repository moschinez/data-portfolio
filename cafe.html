          <section>
            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>
              Today, I’ll be walking you through an interactive Excel dashboard built for
              <strong>Café Harmony</strong>, a fast-growing virtual café chain.
              The goal of this dashboard is to provide clear visibility into sales performance,
              customer behaviour, employee productivity, inventory levels, and customer satisfaction,
              enabling data-driven operational and growth decisions.
            </p>
          </section>

          <section>
            <h2>Sales Performance Overview</h2>
            <h3>Key Business KPIs</h3>
            <p>
              Let’s begin with the key performance indicators displayed on the left side of the dashboard.
              These include Sales Count, Total Sales, Employee Count, and Average Customer Rating.
            </p>
            <p>
              These KPIs provide an immediate snapshot of overall business performance and update dynamically
              as filters such as location, role, or stock level are applied.
            </p>
          </section>

          <section>
            <h2>Sales Trend Analysis</h2>
            <p>
              The Sales Trend chart displays monthly sales performance from January through December.
              This visual helps identify seasonal demand patterns, periods of growth and decline,
              and months that may require promotional activity or operational adjustment.
            </p>
          </section>

          <section>
            <h2>Customer & Revenue Insights</h2>
            <h3>Gender Distribution</h3>
            <p>
              This chart shows the distribution of customers by gender.
              Female customers contribute slightly more to overall sales than male customers,
              offering insight into the café’s core customer base.
            </p>

            <h3>Revenue by Product</h3>
            <p>
              The Revenue by Product chart highlights which menu items generate the most revenue.
              Items such as <strong>Muffins, Cappuccino, and Iced Tea</strong> emerge as top performers,
              supporting menu optimisation and promotional planning.
            </p>
          </section>

          <section>
            <h2>Employee Performance Analysis</h2>
            <p>
              The Top Employees section ranks employees based on their sales contribution.
              This allows management to identify high-performing staff for recognition and
              flag underperformance that may require additional training or support.
            </p>
            <p>
              Role and location filters enable deeper analysis of employee performance
              across different café branches.
            </p>
          </section>

          <section>
            <h2>Stock Performance & Inventory Management</h2>
            <p>
              This section highlights inventory movement across key ingredients and supplies.
              Items such as Milk, Croissant Dough, and Iced Tea Bags frequently run low,
              indicating potential stockout risks.
            </p>
            <p>
              These insights support improved inventory planning, reduced waste,
              and smoother daily operations.
            </p>
          </section>

          <section>
            <h2>Customer Feedback Analysis</h2>
            <p>
              The Customer Ratings chart displays the distribution of customer satisfaction scores
              on a scale from 1 to 5. Most ratings fall between 3 and 5,
              indicating generally positive customer experiences while still highlighting
              opportunities for improvement.
            </p>
          </section>

          <section>
            <h2>Dashboard Interactivity</h2>
            <p>
              All visuals in this dashboard are fully interactive.
              Users can filter the data by role, location, and current stock levels.
              As selections are made, the entire dashboard updates in real time,
              allowing deeper exploration of performance drivers.
            </p>
          </section>

          <section>
            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>
              In summary, this dashboard provides Café Harmony with clear visibility into sales trends,
              customer behaviour, employee performance, inventory health, and customer satisfaction.
            </p>
            <p>
              Overall, the solution empowers management to make strategic, data-driven decisions
              that improve operational efficiency, enhance customer experience,
              and support sustainable business growth.
