          <h2>Business Context</h2>
          <p>
            SwiftRoute Logistics Ltd. is a Manchester-based logistics company with over
            twenty years of experience providing nationwide transportation and last-mile
            delivery services across the United Kingdom.
          </p>
          <p>
            As order volumes increased, the company began experiencing growing order backlogs,
            inconsistent delivery times, and rising customer complaints. The absence of
            centralised performance tracking made it difficult for management to identify
            bottlenecks and proactively address delays.
          </p>

          <hr />

          <h2>Project Objective</h2>
          <p>
            To analyse order fulfilment data using Microsoft Excel and deliver an interactive
            dashboard that tracks delivery performance, identifies the root causes of delays
            and backlogs, and supports data-driven operational decisions.
          </p>

          <hr />

          <h2>Data Sources</h2>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Order Data:</strong> Order ID, Route, Delivery Zone, Order Status</li>
            <li><strong>Delivery Metrics:</strong> Delivery Time, Delay Duration</li>
            <li><strong>Operations:</strong> Driver ID, Vehicle Type, Allocation Rules</li>
            <li><strong>Customer Feedback:</strong> Positive, Neutral, Negative, No Feedback</li>
          </ul>

          <hr />

          <h2>Methodology & Tools</h2>

          <h3>Data Structuring</h3>
          <p>
            Cleaned and standardised route and zone labels, created derived fields such as
            delayed orders and backlog flags, and structured the dataset into Excel Tables
            for reliable aggregation.
          </p>

          <h3>Data Analysis</h3>
          <p>
            Used Pivot Tables and calculated fields to compute KPIs, including
            backlog rate, CSAT percentage, delay rate, and average delivery time
            across routes and zones.
          </p>

          <h3>Dashboard Design</h3>
          <p>
            Built a fully interactive Excel dashboard using KPI tiles, charts,
            slicers, and conditional formatting to enable dynamic performance analysis.
          </p>

          <hr />

          <h2>Key Performance Indicators</h2>
          <p>
            The dashboard tracks four core KPIs:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Total Orders</li>
            <li>Average Customer Satisfaction (CSAT)</li>
            <li>Backlog Rate</li>
            <li>Total Backlog Volume</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            These KPIs update dynamically as filters are applied, providing real-time
            operational visibility.
          </p>

          <hr />

          <h2>Route & Zone Performance Analysis</h2>
          <p>
            Analysis by route shows that Routes 1 and 2 have the highest backlog rates
            (above 51%) and among the lowest CSAT scores, indicating systemic delivery
            challenges rather than isolated incidents.
          </p>
          <p>
            Route 5 presents an interesting pattern — while it has one of the lowest
            average delays, its CSAT remains low, suggesting frequent minor delays
            or unmet delivery expectations.
          </p>

          <hr />

          <h2>Backlog & Delay Insights</h2>
          <p>
            Zone-level analysis reveals that Zone 2 has the highest delay percentage
            and backlog rate, making it a priority area for routing optimisation
            and resource reallocation.
          </p>

          <hr />

          <h2>Customer Feedback Analysis</h2>
          <p>
            Customer feedback analysis shows that only about 15% of deliveries receive
            positive feedback, while over half of the orders have no feedback recorded.
            This highlights both service improvement opportunities and gaps in customer
            engagement.
          </p>

          <hr />

          <h2>Dashboard Interactivity</h2>
          <p>
            The dashboard includes slicers for delivery zone, route, driver, vehicle type,
            order status, and customer feedback. All visuals update instantly,
            allowing stakeholders to drill down into specific operational segments.
          </p>

          <hr />

          <h2>Expected Business Impact</h2>
          <ul>
            <li>20–30% reduction in order backlogs through improved routing</li>
            <li>More consistent delivery times and higher on-time delivery rates</li>
            <li>Reduced operational costs from fewer expedited deliveries</li>
            <li>Improved customer satisfaction through targeted interventions</li>
            <li>Centralized, automated performance reporting</li>
          </ul>
